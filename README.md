# **Machine Learning Model Comparison for Predictive Analysis**

Welcome to the Machine Learning Model Comparison for Predictive Analysis repository! This project showcases an interactive Shiny dashboard that compares the performance of five machine learning algorithms in predictive analytics. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of model accuracies and enables an interactive exploration of actual vs. predicted results, facilitating a better understanding of model performance.

## **Key Features**

**Interactive Dashboard:** Visualize and compare the performance of five machine learning algorithms — KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression. <br>
**Comprehensive Accuracy Comparison:** Examine model accuracy in a clear, concise bar chart, along with individual accuracy metrics displayed in value boxes. <br>
**Actual vs. Predicted Analysis:** Explore the relationship between actual and predicted values through scatter plots for selected models, giving insights into prediction reliability. <br>
**Detailed Data Table:** Access a complete data table, making it easy to review the data used in model training and testing. <br>

## **The Dashboard Consists of:**

**Comparison Tab:** Displays value boxes with accuracy metrics for each model, a bar plot for model accuracy comparison, and scatter plots showing actual vs. predicted values for selected models.
**Data Tab:** Displays the complete dataset in a tabular format for reference.

## **Objective**
The objective of this project is to create an interactive platform for comparing machine learning model accuracies in predictive analysis. This tool is designed to support data scientists and analysts in selecting the most effective model based on accuracy and prediction patterns.

## **Contributions Welcome**
Contributions to this project are encouraged! Whether it’s improving the dashboard design, refining model accuracy, or adding new visualizations, your input is valuable in advancing the project.
